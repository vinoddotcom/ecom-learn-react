# Documentation Updates

I've updated and created several documentation files to better reflect our current infrastructure setup and deployment processes. These documents provide comprehensive guidance on our Terraform setup, CI/CD pipeline, state management, and GitHub OIDC authentication.

## New Documentation Files

### 2. Updated CI/CD Environments Documentation

**File**: `/docs/updated-ci-cd-environments.md`

This document explains:

- How our multi-environment CI/CD pipeline works
- GitHub OIDC authentication for secure AWS access
- Environment setup in GitHub

This guide explains:

- AWS infrastructure components managed by Terraform
- Terraform remote state management
- Multi-environment setup with workspaces
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Security considerations

### 4. GitHub OIDC Authentication

A new document that explains:

- How OIDC authentication works
- Benefits over traditional access keys
- Implementation details in our project
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Security best practices

### 5. Terraform State Management Guide

**File**: `/docs/terraform-state-management-guide.md`

An expanded guide on Terraform state management:

- How state is bootstrapped and organized

### 6. Git Branch to Terraform Workspace Binding

**File**: `/docs/git-terraform-workspace-binding.md`

A detailed explanation of:

- How Git branches map to Terraform workspaces

- Adding new environments

## Recommended Actions

1. Review the new documentation files
2. Replace the existing files with the updated versions:

   - `docs/deployment.md` → `docs/updated-deployment.md`
   - `docs/ci-cd-environments.md` → `docs/updated-ci-cd-environments.md`
   - `docs/s3-deployment-setup.md` → `docs/updated-s3-deployment-setup.md`

3. Add the new documentation files to your main README as references

4. Update the project's main documentation to link to these more detailed guides

## Benefits of These Updates

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documentation now fully reflects your current infrastructure setup
- **Better Onboarding**: New team members can understand the system more quickly
- **Troubleshooting Aid**: Common issues and their solutions are documented
- **Security Emphasis**: Best practices for secure deployment are highlighted
- **CI/CD Clarity**: The relationship between Git branches and environments is clearly explained
